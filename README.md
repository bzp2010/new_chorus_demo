# New Chorus2 Demo

## Proposal

[Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AiTWqbltKY1r6NJKD3bCYjvWJpRPEWUCW8qL3SQl96k/edit?usp=sharing)

## Project ideas

I searched somethings about elm-lang and referenced Google Trends data. Its community is relatively small, with less users, less documents, and less libraries.
This means that a large number of people cannot contribute to the project with existing knowledge. (Based on a large amount of search data, elm-lang has almost no attention compared to JavaScript)

[Google Trends Data](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=elm-lang,javascript,typescript)

Therefore, I sincerely recommend using mainstream programming languages and development frameworks such as JavaScript and React.js for this project.

Some of the original Material Design and grid layout systems may be migrated to the Material-UI component library, which will reduce the workload and improve reliability.

Other Sass styles used in the original project will be rewritten. But does not significantly change its final style.

Compared to other proposals, I don't want to introduce new back-end components between the front-end and Kodi, which will increase the running cost and unreliability of the web interface. (Running new binaries, causing compatibility issues on different platforms)

## Run Demo

Demo is only used to prove that I have a certain programming experience and does not represent the final effect of the project.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
